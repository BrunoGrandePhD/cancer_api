# cancergen

cancergen is a Python module that serves to handle and store data typically encountered in cancer genomics. This includes mutation data, patients, tissue samples and related libraries. The structure of this module is to represent each entity by a Python class/model, which can optionally be stored in a database using peewee, a simple ORM for Python.
